## **Project Proposal:**

Create a turn-based Unity-based game using a simple hex map, in which the playerâ€™s goal is to expand their single hex village into a megalopolis. Progression in the game is influenced by 4 resources that the player can obtain; food, wood, metal, and tech. Certain resources such as tech points are rewarded by correctly answering questions posed by the game - which are based on the questions posed in the Skills Build Getting Started Credentials. AI players will develop their own cities at a steady rate and will challenge the player.


## **User Stories:**
1.) As **Developers**, we would like to create an engaging learning experience when learning concepts relating to computer science, so to do this we will create a game that encourages and rewards the user to understand such concepts.

2.)  As **Computer Science Students**, we want to understand the ideas of our subject without feeling intimidated by such ideas, this game should allow us students to learn the subject in a much more relaxing environment.

3.) As **partners of IBM**, we would like to encourage its players to study their IBM Skills Build AI, DataScience, DesignThinking, Cloud and Cybersecurity Getting Started Courses

  
  

## **Stakeholders:**
- **Clients**

Client is International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) who is interested in helping people learn some hugely intimidating computer science fields when they need to touch those projects in the first time. At the moment, IBM has created a powerful website that includes AI, DataScience, DesignThinking, Cloud, and CyberSecurity knowledge, they can adapt those courses to a game that will facilitate the learning and research process.

- **Participants**

Participants usually are students who are willing to learn computer science knowledge. As the main beneficiaries, they can figure out several different knowledge is their strengths or weaknesses by answering the questions from the game. Participants do not worry about getting the wrong answer, the game will show the link that directly connects to IBM Skills Build website to gain information about that area. Additionally, the system will rank the questions from easy to difficult, so participants will have a smooth learning process during the game.
