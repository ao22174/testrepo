## **Project Proposal:**

Create a turn-based react.js-based game using a simple hex map, in which the playerâ€™s goal is to expand their single hex village into a megalopolis. Progression in the game is influenced by 4 resources that the player can obtain; food, wood, metal, and tech. Certain resources such as tech points are rewarded by correctly answering questions posed by the game - which are based on the questions posed in the Skills Build Getting Started Credentials. AI players will develop their own cities at a steady rate and will challenge the player.


## **User Stories:**
1.) As **Developers**, we would like to create an engaging learning experience when learning concepts relating to computer science, so to do this we will create a game that encourages and rewards the user to understand such concepts.

2.)  As **Computer Science Students**, we want to understand the ideas of our subject without feeling intimidated by such ideas, this game should allow us students to learn the subject in a much more relaxing environment.

3.) As **partners of IBM**, we would like to encourage its players to study their IBM Skills Build AI, DataScience, DesignThinking, Cloud and Cybersecurity Getting Started Courses
